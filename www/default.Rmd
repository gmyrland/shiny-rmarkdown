This is sample rmarkdown code, rendered in a running shiny app.
Belowis a table from `mtcars`.

```{r}
head(mtcars,6) %>%
    knitr::kable(caption="Table 1 - First few rows of mtcars.")
```

## Basic Question

Does additional horsepower correlate wth additional vehicle weight?
The following plot shows this relationship.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, wt)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

## Results

Based on the graph, 

- increasing horsepower is correlated with increasing weight.
